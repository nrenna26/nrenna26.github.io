    <b> What if anything is the difference between speed a acceleration? </b>
    Speed dictates that we may be moving fast, but only within a defined set
    of capitalist parameters. It is similar to a onrush rather than a
    navigational, experiemental process of discovery that is the basis for
    the acceleration manifesto.
