    <b> What if anything is the difference between speed a acceleration? </b>
    Speed dictates that we may be moving fast, but only within a defined set
    of capitalist parameters. It is similar to a onrush rather than a
    navigational, experiemental process of discovery that is the basis for
    the acceleration manifesto. The manifesto theorizes that there is a choice
    facing humanity. The choice is either a "globalised post-capitalism or a slow fragmentation
towards primitivism, perpetual crisis, and planetary ecological collapse."
