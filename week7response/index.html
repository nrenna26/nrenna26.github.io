    <p>
      “i don’t know what living a balanced life feels like <br>
when i am sad <br>
i don’t cry i pour <br>
when i am happy <br>
i don’t smile i glow <br>
when i am angry <br>
i don’t yell i burn <br>
the good thing about <br>
feeling in extremes <br>
is when i love <br>
i give them wings <br>
but perhaps <br>
that isn't <br>
such a good thing <br>
cause they always <br>
tend to leave and <br>
you should see me <br>
when my heart is broken <br>
i don't grieve” <br>
