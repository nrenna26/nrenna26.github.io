  <p>What was the cultural impact of cybenetics?

    Cybernetics saw human beings not as individuals, but as components in systems.
    It was a computer's perspective of the world and reduced human beings to just
    parts of a system. Humans and machines could be one in the same. One of the
    founding similarities is that humans and machines both function through
    feedback loops. If we take Howard Odum's ideas and draw ecosystems as energy
    circuits, we can see how the energy flows from one organism to the other.
    The Odum brothers simplified the natural world and created a scientific
    description of reality. In this experiement, the brothers didn't account for
    the unpredictability and randomness of the natural world. This fusion of
    cybernetics and ecology started a new organizing principle for human society
    as well. There was a new vision for the ordinary world that mirrored how order
    was created in nature. People should see themselves as equal members in the
    system, not further defined by hierarchy, careers, education etc. Should the
    world be seen as one giant spaceship? De-emphasizing the importance of the
    human being to help the welfare of all humans.
